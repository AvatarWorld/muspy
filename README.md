# MusPy

A Python package for processing symbolic music and working with common music datasets.

## Documentation

Documentation is provided as docstrings with the code.

## Development environment setup

The development environment can be set up by running `pipenv install --dev` (make sure pipenv is installed properly, otherwise run `pip install pipenv`). This will install the linters (Pylint, Flake8 and mypy) and the formatter (black). The imports are sorted using VSCode Python extension (command: `python.sortImports`). The documentation is in NumPy style. Use of type hints are recommended.
